      <h1>The Fractured Realm</h1>
      <h2>Game Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In The Fractured Realm, players enter a once-vast empire now fragmented
        into warring factions and independent territories following the sudden
        death of a powerful emperor. The power vacuum leads to chaos, with
        nobles, generals, and opportunists vying for control. Players must
        navigate this treacherous environment, making alliances, securing
        resources, and building armies to establish their own dominion.
