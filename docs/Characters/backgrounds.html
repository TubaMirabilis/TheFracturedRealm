      <h1>Backgrounds</h1>
      <h2>Noble</h2>
      <p>
        Nobles are born into wealth, education, and influence. Skilled in
        diplomacy, leadership, and etiquette, they navigate complex hierarchies
        with ease, often managing estates, hosting grand events, or negotiating
        treaties. Their refined manners and high status grant them access to
        privileges others can only imagine.
      </p>
      <h2>Outlaw</h2>
      <p>
        Outlaws live beyond the law, thriving on stealth, deception, and
        survival. They reject authority, forging their own paths as bandits,
        pirates, or freedom fighters. Renowned for rugged independence, they
        raid caravans, challenge oppressive regimes, and rely on cunning to
        endure in hostile worlds.
      </p>
      <h2>Merchant</h2>
      <p>
        Merchants are savvy traders and resource managers who excel in
        negotiation and commerce. They profit from buying, selling, and
        investing, often rising to positions of wealth and influence. Whether
        guildmasters or smugglers, merchants shape markets, finance expeditions,
        and exploit every opportunity for gain.
      </p>
      <h2>Peasant</h2>
      <p>
        Peasants are humble folk working the land, skilled in farming, animal
        husbandry, and survival. They know the value of hard work, stewardship,
        and resilience. Often tending fields or raising livestock, peasants form
        the foundation of agrarian life and rural communities.
      </p>
      <h2>Academic</h2>
      <p>
        Academics are scholars, researchers, and teachers dedicated to
        knowledge, learning, and the arcane. They study ancient texts, conduct
        experiments, and impart wisdom. Whether historians, alchemists, or
        theologians, academics uncover secrets, push boundaries, and shape
        intellectual life in libraries, laboratories, and temples.
      </p>
      <h2>Adventurer</h2>

        and treasure hunting, they brave ruins and dungeons in pursuit of wealth
        and renown. Whether explorers, monster slayers, or treasure hunters,
        adventurers find excitement and risk around every corner.
      </p>
      <h2>Entertainer</h2>
      <p>
        Entertainers are performers who captivate audiences with music, dance,
        storytelling, and other arts. Using creativity, charisma, and passion,
        they bring joy and unity to taverns, theaters, and courts. As bards,
        jesters, or actors, entertainers enliven a troubled world with moments
        of wonder.
      </p>
      <h2>Hermit</h2>
      <p>
        Hermits live in isolation, seeking wisdom, spiritual insight, and
        communion with the divine. Skilled in meditation and divination, they
        often serve as healers, prophets, or ascetics, guiding seekers toward
        enlightenment. They dwell in remote places, contemplating mysteries and
        offering solace to those who find them.
      </p>
      <h2>Scoundrel</h2>
      <p>
        Scoundrels are charming tricksters who thrive on deception, gambling,
        and mischief. They relish chaos, find clever ways to profit, and delight
        in outwitting foes. As con artists, gamblers, or pranksters, scoundrels
        amuse, baffle, and confound the unwary.
      </p>
      <h2>Wanderer</h2>
      <p>
        Wanderers are nomads and travelers who cherish freedom, exploration, and
        discovery. Skilled in navigation, survival, and storytelling, they
        follow the open road to distant horizons. As explorers, traders, or
        guides, wanderers rely on independence, curiosity, and adaptability to
        thrive.
      </p>
      <h2>Zealot</h2>
      <p>
        Zealots are true believers, devoted to a cause, deity, or ideology.
        Skilled in persuasion, devotion, and combat, they inspire others to join
        their crusade. Holy warriors, cult leaders, or political agitators,
        zealots fight fervently to reshape the world according to their
        convictions.
