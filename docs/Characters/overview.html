      <h2>Player Characters</h2>
      <p>
        In The Fractured Realm, players create and customize their own
        characters. Each character has unique abilities, strengths, and
        weaknesses that can be developed over time, reflecting the player's
        chosen playstyle.
      </p>
      <h2>Non-Player Characters</h2>
      <p>
        The world is populated by various non-player characters (NPCs),
        including nobles, generals, merchants, and other figures. These NPCs
        have their own goals, motivations, and relationships, influencing the
        player's experiences and the unfolding narrative.
      </p>
      <h2>Companions</h2>
      <p>
        Players can recruit companions to join their adventures. These allies
        have distinctive abilities, personalities, and provide valuable support
        in combat, exploration, and other situations.
      </p>

        A variety of enemies—rival factions, beasts, and other threats—populate
        the realm. Overcoming these adversaries is essential to achieving goals,
        securing resources, and establishing dominion.

      <h2>Character Progression</h2>
      <p>
        As characters gain experience, they can level up, acquire new skills,
        and enhance their abilities. Players customize their character's
        development to suit personal strategies and preferences.
